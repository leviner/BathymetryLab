    "# Part 1: Determining the Speed of Sound in Air\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you will be using a **HCSR04** 40 kHz ultrasonic sensor to determine the speed of sound in air.  This sensor sends out a pulse of sound through one transducer, and listens for the echo return in the second transducer.  Based on the delay between sending the signal and receiving an echo back, you will be able to determine how far away an object is from the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance we are unsure of the speed of sound in air.  By collecting measurements at a known distance, we can see how changing the speed of sound affects the accuracy of distance the sensor calculates, and narrow in on the correct value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembling the HCSR04 Sensor\n",
    "Begin by connecting your **HCSR04** to your **ESP8266**.  The HCSR04 requires 5 volts, so for this excersize you will use your microcontroller in a breadboard, powered by the USB cable from your computer.  The USB cable provides 5V to the board, which means we can use the *V+* pin on the ESP8266 to give 5V to the HCSR04.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HCSR04 sensor has 4 pins, *GND*, *VCC*, *Trig*, and *Echo*.  For this excercise, connect the *trig* pin on the HCSR04 to GPIO \\#12 on the ESP8266, and the *echo* pin to GPIO \\#14.  Connect *GND* to *GND* and *VCC* to *V+*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The driver for this sensor is already included in the firmware on your **ESP8266** as a module named `hcsr04`.  The `hcsr04.HCSR04` class requires three input variables:\n",
    "- `trigger_pin`,  the GPIO pin on the ESP8266 corresponding to the **Trig** pin on the HCSR04\n",
    "- `echo_pin`,  the GPIO pin on the ESP8266 corresponding to the **Echo** pin on the HCSR04\n",
    "- `c`, the speed of sound to use to calculate distance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by estimating that the speed of sound in air is **300 meters per second**, so we will set our variable `c` to 300 and we can define our sensor using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import hcsr04\n",
    "sensor = hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin = 12, echo_pin = 14, c = 300)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Distance\n",
    "Once your sensor variable is defined, you can take a measurement by executing the function `distance`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sensor.distance()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ESP8266 should return a float value that corresponds to the distance of the object in front of the sensor in **millimeters**.  Try pointing your sensor at an object, moving it closer and further away while taking measurements to see how the value changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating `c`\n",
    "We are now going to record a series of measurements at a known distance while adjusting sound speed (`c`) to determine the correct value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, lets define `c` as a list of test values (as floats) by entering a new variable on the ESP8266:\n",
    "\n",
    "`c = [100., 150., 200., 250., 300., 350., 400., 450.]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following code to collect distance measurements at each value of `c` that you just defined on your ESP8266:"
