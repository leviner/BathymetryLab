    "# Part 1: Determining the Speed of Sound in Air\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you will be using a **HCSR04** 40 kHz ultrasonic sensor to determine the speed of sound in air.  This sensor sends out a pulse of sound, then listens for the echo return.  Based on the delay between sending the signal and receiving an echo back, you will be able to determine how far away an object is from the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance we are unsure of the speed of sound in air.  By collecting measurements at a known distance, we can see how changing the speed of sound affects the accuracy of distance the sensor measures, and narrow in on the correct value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembling the HCSR04 Sensor\n",
    "Begin by connecting your **HCSR04** to your **ESP8266**.  The HCSR04 requires 5 volts, so for this excersize you will use your microcontroller in a breadboard, powered by the USB cable from your computer.  The USB cable provides 5V to the board, which means we can use the *USB* pin on the ESP8266 to give 5V to the HCSR04.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HCSR04 sensor has 4 pins, *GND*, *VCC*, *Trig*, and *Echo*.  For this excercise, connect the *trig* pin on the HCSR04 to GPIO \\#12 on the ESP8266, and the *echo* pin to GPIO \\#14.  Connect *GND* to *GND* and *5V* to *USB*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating c\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to record a series of measurements at a known distance while adjusting sound speed (`c`) to determine the correct value.  "
