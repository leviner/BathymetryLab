    "## Milestone Items\n",
    "The following are required to complete the milestone for this exercise:\n",
    "1. Submit your figure of the bathymetry along the dock\n",
    "2. Submit the python code used to create your figure\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a 2-3 sentence response addressing the following milestone questions:\n",
    "- Why might you have gotten inconsistent readings when taking measurements off of the dock?\n",
    "- If you were to use an underwater echosounder in Puget Sound instead of Portage Bay, how and why might you expect the speed of sound to differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "For this activity, you will be using a **HCSR04** 40 kHz ultrasonic sensor to determine the bathymetry along the dock.  The HCSR04 sensor sends out a pulse of sound through one transducer, and listens for the echo return in the second transducer.  Based on the delay between sending the signal and receiving an echo back, you will be able to determine how far away an object is from the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity uses the waterproof transducer version of the HCSR04 ultrasonic acoustic sensor called a **JSN-SR04** to create a rough bathymetric chart of a region of off a pier or dock.  For this excercise you will collect measurements of the depth to the seafloor along the dock with 1 meter spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bathymetry Measurements\n",
    "You will be using the JSN-SR04 to collect measurements of depth at a series of fixed positions along the dock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the Sound Speed\n",
    "First, we need to define the sound speed of the water so we can get a correct measure from distance.  Recall from Part 1 that slight changes in sound speed affect the distance calculated.  We'll define sound speed as the following:\n"
