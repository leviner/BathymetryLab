    "## Milestone Items\n",
    "The following are required to complete the milestone for this exercise:\n",
    "1. Submit your figure of the bathymetry along the dock\n",
    "2. Submit the python code used to create your figure\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a 2-3 sentence response addressing the following milestone questions:\n",
    "- Why might you have gotten inconsistent readings when taking measurements off of the dock?\n",
    "- If you were to use an underwater echosounder in Puget Sound instead of Portage Bay, how and why might you expect the speed of sound to differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "For this activity, you will be using a 40 kHz ultrasonic sensor to determine the bathymetry along the dock.  The sensor sends out a pulse of sound through one transducer, and listens for the echo return in the second transducer.  Based on the delay between sending the signal and receiving an echo back, you will be able to determine how far away an object is from the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity uses the waterproof transducer version of ultrasonic acoustic sensor called a **JSN-SR04** to create a rough bathymetric chart of a region of off a pier or dock.  For this excercise you will collect measurements of the depth to the seafloor along the dock with 1 meter spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/Feather_jsnsr04.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembling your JSN-SR04 Sensor\n",
    "Begin by connecting the **JSN-SR04** to your **ESP8266**.  The JSN-SR04 uses the same wiring as the HCSR04 (above) and  requires 5 volts, so for this excersize you will use your microcontroller in a breadboard, powered by the USB cable from your computer  The USB cable provides 5V to the board, which means we can use the *USB* pin on the ESP8266 to give 5V to the JSN-SR04.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSN-SR04 sensor has 4 pins, *GND*, *VCC*, *Trig*, and *Echo*.  For this excercise, connect the *trig* pin on the JSN-SR04 to GPIO pin 12 on the ESP8266, and the *echo* pin to GPIO pin 14.  Connect *GND* to *GND* and *VCC* to *USB*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/jsnsr04.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The driver for this sensor is already included in the firmware on your **ESP8266** as a module named `hcsr04`. The `hcsr04.HCSR04` class requires three input variable:\n",
    "- `trigger_pin`,  the GPIO pin on the ESP8266 corresponding to the **trig** pin on the JSN-SR04\n",
    "- `echo_pin`,  the GPIO pin on the ESP8266 corresponding to the **echo** pin on the JSN-SR04\n",
    "- `c`, the speed of sound to use to calculate distance\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define our sensor using the following code.  We will proceed by estimating that the speed of sound in fresh water is **1500 meters per second**, so we will define our variable `c` as 1500:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import hcsr04\n",
    "sensor = hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin = 12, echo_pin = 14, c = 1500)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Distance\n",
    "Once your sensor variable is defined, you can take a measurement by executing the function `distance`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sensor.distance()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ESP8266 should return an integer value that corresponds to the distance of the object in front of the sensor in **millimeters**.  Try pointing your sensor at an object and moving it closer and further away from it while taking measurements to see how the value changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the limits of your sensor.  Does there appear to be a minimum distance you can measure?  Does there appear to be a maximum distance?  What happens when it seems like you might be too far away or too close to take a measurement?  How accurate do the measurements appear to be when collected in air?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bathymetry Measurements\n",
    "You will be using the HCSR04 to collect measurements of depth at a series of fixed positions along the dock.  Using the tape measure, start at the western corner of the dock and take a measurement at 1 meter spacing.  Lower the transducer into the water to the tape mark indicating 10cm is at the surface.  Collect and record samples in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Distance on Dock (m) | Depth (mm)|\n",
    "| :---:  |  :---: |\n",
    "|1| Meaurement \\#1,  \\#2,  \\#3,  \\#4,  \\#5|\n",
    "|2| Meaurement \\#1,  \\#2,  \\#3,  \\#4,  \\#5|\n",
    "|...|...|\n",
    "|*n*| Meaurement \\#1,  \\#2,  \\#3,  \\#4,  \\#5|\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect repeat samples at each fixed distance point.  Do all of the values collected appear to be valid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your sample table is complete, create a plot of the bathymetry in *Canopy* using the Python code below.  For the depth value, take the median of the measurements at each distance that you believe to be correct in order to remove bad samples or noise.  "
